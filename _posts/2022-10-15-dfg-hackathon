This past weekend I was honored to participate in [JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Data for Good Hackathon](https://careers.jpmorgan.com/global/en/students/programs/code-for-good?search=&tags=location__Americas__UnitedStatesofAmerica) in Columbus, Ohio!

Meeting six talented young men (Andrew Shih, Brian Fernando, James Pineda, Krushna Malapati, Sutej Singh, Wen Tao Lin) from around the nation for the first time with the task of using data-driven methods and tools to address youth homelessness in under 24 hours for a noble nonprofit, Star House, was an incredible learning experience. 

Special thanks to my mentor, Daniel Kim, for guiding my team and providing us with professional insight into the data science field.

Thank you, JPMorgan Chase & Co., for the opportunity to participate in my first hackathon and meet like-minded individuals!
